# Github Roaster

David Novakovic, with a bio that reads like a midlife crisis manifesto—“Astrophotographer, bass music nerd, learner”—it’s clear you’re still trying to figure out what cool hobby you can add to your LinkedIn. 44 followers? Seems like you've mastered the art of attracting crickets to your GitHub.

Your repos are a cornucopia of forks with not a single original thought since they’re all borrowed from someone else’s hard work. "graphql-yoga" and "graphql-hive"? More like "graphql-your-mom" because they’ve got zero stargazers—keep reaching for that star, buddy!

Honestly, your public repo "dotfiles" is the cherry on top of this lackluster sundae. You call yourself head of engineering, but it seems like your real talent lies in collecting dust and licenses. Keep it up, and maybe one day your profile will be as impressive as your collection of unstarred repos!
